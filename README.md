## Hi there 👋

I'm a systems engineer with a strong background in backend infrastructure, internal tooling, and automation. Much of my past work has been developed at large corporations and used in production environments — though not publicly released. I'm now focused on building a more open portfolio that reflects both my technical skills and forward-thinking mindset.

## 🔍 What I Bring

- 🛠️ **Backend Utilities & Automation**  
  Designed and maintained tools for automated testing, automated inventory management, infrastructure management, automated alert management — used internally at scale.
  
- ☁️ **Cloud & Systems Engineering**  
  Experienced across bare metal, virtual machines, and Kubernetes environments, with a focus on observability and reliability.

- 📊 **Data Analysis & Reporting**  
  Skilled in R, Python, SQL, and Tableau; recently applied to urban mobility datasets and weather analytics using Quarto and SQLite.

- 🐚 **Deep UNIX Experience**
  Decades of hands-on work across AIX, HP-UX, IRIX, Linux, SunOS, and Solaris — from scripting and performance tuning to backend systems architecture. Comfortable working with both modern distros and legacy environments in transition. 

- 🧠 **Continuous Learning**  
  I believe in learning by building, and I’ve been actively growing my skills this year across multiple domains
  - 🐍 Data & Cloud Analysis – Completed the Google Cloud Data Analytics and Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, final case study available on GitHub (linked below)
  - 🧱 Kubernetes Administration – Preparing for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam
  - 📈 Visualization Tools – Hands-on with Tableau, Quarto, and ggplot2 for real-world reporting and dashboards
  - 🖥️ Infrastructure as Code – Exploring Terraform, Prometheus, and Redpanda

## 📁 Featured Work

### 📊 [Bikes Share Case Study](https://sasgithub.github.io/Data_Analytics_cs/)  
An in-depth analysis of urban bike-sharing behavior in Chicago.  
Built using SQLite, R, and Quarto with integrated weather data.  
Includes visualizations, derived data products, and structured analysis.

### 🧠 [2⁵ Programming Contest Entries](https://github.com/sasgithub/TwoToTheFifth)
Creative, compact code written under tight constraints for fun and challenge.  
Highlights clarity, expressiveness, and problem-solving with minimal code.

### ⚙️  Internal Tools (Reimagined)  
I'm actively rewriting and open-sourcing improved versions of past backend utilities, including:
- Clogger - An application for monitoring, logging and controlling terminal servers. 
- Testy - A minimalistic automation framework for testing (and more). 
- Monitoring & automation scripts

### 📍 Visualizing Top Bike Stations with Leaflet

Kaggle Notebook

This project explores high-volume Divvy bike stations in Chicago using pandas for data wrangling and folium (Leaflet) for interactive mapping. It highlights how geospatial patterns in urban mobility can be visualized to support planning and user behavior analysis.

## 🚧 In Progress

- 🀄 **Mahjong Solitaire Mobile Game**  
  Built in Flutter. In active development and private testing.

- 📝 **Modern Line Editor ("fat ED" Redux)**  
  Inspired by legacy tools, adapted for scripting and extremely large file manipulation.
